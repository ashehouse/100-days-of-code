# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 26, 2020 
##### Start: 10:14 am end 4:15pm

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** I was struggling understanding Flex vs Grid and how to center things. Turned out that getting text and images to center inside of a container required just a text-align command. I think I have a better understanding of flex. Tomorrow I will work on understanding grid better. 



### Day 2: March 27, 2020 
##### Start: 10:30am End 2:53pm

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** Today marks the first official day of 'Stay Home, Stay Safe' orders from Bunbcombe County. You can go for hikes, go to the grocery store, and of course seek healthcare. Shouldn't change my life too much as that's prety much the way that I lived before. I'm trying to establish a routine for myself so that I can best utilize this time for learning to code. The idea is to structure my days like I'm in college. MWF two courses, TTH another two courses. I'm alos taking advantage of the nice weather and have set up my laptop outside on the porch. 

Update: not getting it. So struggling with this whole grid thing right now. I'm also don't think I'm understanding inheriting now. My boxes aren't centering and the grid isn't laying out how I want. The whole @media thing doesn't seem like its working. ugh. I need to take a break for today. 



### Day 3: March 28, 2020 
##### Start: 11:25am End 3:00pm

**Today's Progress**: Got the mobile site to work and be laid out how I wanted it. Including putting the sidebar at the bottom of the main blog listing section.

**Thoughts:** Still working on this grid thing. I got the @media to work from yesterday. Also go the smaller screen (tablet and movile) to work. But, now I'm struggling with larger screens which is essentially the whole thing about grid. So just when I felt like I had it, I didn't. I tried to work on it again at night, but it wasn't happening. So I'm not really counting that time toward my final coding time.




### Day 4: March 29, 2020 
##### Start: 4:00pm End 6pm-ish

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the grid. 

**Thoughts:**: I had the mobile version working and looking how I wanted it to. Then finally I got the desktop version to work! I was so pumped. But then I went back to check on my mobile version and it now has two columns for some reason and the top nav bar is showing up when it shouldn't be! It's probably something in my base css. Grr. 




### Day 5: March 30, 2020 
##### Start: 8:15am End: Noonish

**Today's Progress**: Done with sample blog project! On to JavaScript

**Thoughts:**: I'm not sure why, but when I booted up my blog this morning both the mobile and desktop versions worked perfectly! All I had to do was fix the individual blog post css and html pages and I resubmitted it! Finally!

I then moved on to JavaScript. The first lesson in Udacity seemed like they dived right in and I didn't understand any of their terminology. So I decided to switch gears temporarily and go through the Free Code Camp's Beginniner JavaScript. Got 50% of the way through. So far it's very familar to the Harvard cs50 course.  



### Day 5: March 31, 2020 
##### Start: 8:17am End: 2:15pm

**Today's Progress**: I'm about 80% of the way through the Free Code Academy Beginner JavaScript certification course. But I also started the Intro to JavaScript free course on Udacity. I finished today on lesson 2.

**Thoughts:**: As I was plugging away at the JavaScript I felt like there was some really basic component that I was missing. Like how it ties into webpages and why you'd use it and just bascially - what is it? So I found the free Intro to JavaScript course on Udacity. And thank goodness because it was exactly what I was looking for. The good news is that I seemed to have been getting the basic operations of it down from the Free Code Camp courses so once I understand what the heck it is, I'll be able to go throught that easier. 



### Day 6: April 1, 2020
##### Start: 3pm End: 3:30pm

**Today's Progress**: Going through Udacity Intro to JavaScript. Done with Lesson one and half way through lesson 2.

**Thoughts:**: Just seems like a review of what I was doing with Free Code Camp



### Day 6: April 2, 2020
##### Start: 3pm ish End: 4:32pm

**Today's Progress**: Going through Udacity Intro to JavaScript. Done with Lesson two and half way through lesson 3.

**Thoughts:**: Just seems like a review of what I was doing with Free Code Camp



### Day 10: April 4, 2020
##### Start: No idea - been at it most of the day off and on.

**Today's Progress**: Working on nested ternary operators.  

**Thoughts:**: Well first of all, I'm not doing a good job of keeping up this journal of days. I have been good at posting to twiiter though. So far that's been actually kind of fun. A very positive and supportive community of people. At least that's the group the almighty algorithim has put me in, of which I'm thankful. Twitter can be a aweful aweful place.  

I do have to say the last three days - it's been hard to concentrate. A lot of personal stuff going on, plus - well there's the pesky pandemic. I don't want this to be about that though. But it is making it hard to concentrate. But today I blame myself only. I was doing good this morning, but then I went down some rabbit hole because I wanted to look up how to get become Shopify Certified so that I can start marketing myself. Hours lost. 

I'm impatient to learn. Or more - I'm impatient to work. But I feel like I'm not at the the basic enough level to start marketing my services. Like there is just too much basic information to learn before I can start. But at the same time I feel like the opportunity is NOW. I need to strike while the iron is hot, but I don't have the hammer or tool to forge with, so I'm left with a hot piece of iron just sitting there cooling in front of me. Bryan would say I'm being too cautious. To just go for it! But I'm afraid someone will actually want to hire me and I won't know what to do. Plus I don't know hat direction to go with all this. Do I want to build websites? Design websites? Do frontend? Or do I want to help people get up and running? What ar emy skills? What knowledge from my years of experience running a business can I pair with tech knowledge to make this into something? To much over thinking. I just need to do. Maybe I just need to structure my time better to allow for my mind to wander for a bit and then time to learn.
