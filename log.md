# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 26, 2020 
##### Start: 10:14 am end 4:15pm

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** I was struggling understanding Flex vs Grid and how to center things. Turned out that getting text and images to center inside of a container required just a text-align command. I think I have a better understanding of flex. Tomorrow I will work on understanding grid better. 

**Link to work:** none.
