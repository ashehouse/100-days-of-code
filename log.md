# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 26, 2020 
##### Start: 10:14 am end 4:15pm

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** I was struggling understanding Flex vs Grid and how to center things. Turned out that getting text and images to center inside of a container required just a text-align command. I think I have a better understanding of flex. Tomorrow I will work on understanding grid better.

### Day 2: March 27, 2020 
##### Start: 10:30am End 2:53pm

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** Today marks the first official day of 'Stay Home, Stay Safe' orders from Bunbcombe County. You can go for hikes, go to the grocery store, and of course seek healthcare. Shouldn't change my life too much as that's prety much the way that I lived before. I'm trying to establish a routine for myself so that I can best utilize this time for learning to code. The idea is to structure my days like I'm in college. MWF two courses, TTH another two courses. I'm alos taking advantage of the nice weather and have set up my laptop outside on the porch. 

Update: not getting it. So struggling with this whole grid thing right now. I'm also don't think I'm understanding inheriting now. My boxes aren't centering and the grid isn't laying out how I want. The whole @media thing doesn't seem like its working. ugh. I need to take a break for today.

### Day 3: March 28, 2020 
##### Start: 11:25am End 3:00pm

**Today's Progress**: Got the mobile site to work and be laid out how I wanted it. Including putting the sidebar at the bottom of the main blog listing section.

**Thoughts:** Still working on this grid thing. I got the @media to work from yesterday. Also go the smaller screen (tablet and movile) to work. But, now I'm struggling with larger screens which is essentially the whole thing about grid. So just when I felt like I had it, I didn't. I tried to work on it again at night, but it wasn't happening. So I'm not really counting that time toward my final coding time.

### Day 4: March 29, 2020 
##### Start: 4:00pm End 6pm-ish

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the grid. 

**Thoughts:**: I had the mobile version working and looking how I wanted it to. Then finally I got the desktop version to work! I was so pumped. But then I went back to check on my mobile version and it now has two columns for some reason and the top nav bar is showing up when it shouldn't be! It's probably something in my base css. Grr.

### Day 5: March 30, 2020 
##### Start: 8:15am End: Noonish

**Today's Progress**: Done with sample blog project! On to JavaScript

**Thoughts:**: I'm not sure why, but when I booted up my blog this morning both the mobile and desktop versions worked perfectly! All I had to do was fix the individual blog post css and html pages and I resubmitted it! Finally!

I then moved on to JavaScript. The first lesson in Udacity seemed like they dived right in and I didn't understand any of their terminology. So I decided to switch gears temporarily and go through the Free Code Camp's Beginniner JavaScript. Got 50% of the way through. So far it's very familar to the Harvard cs50 course.
