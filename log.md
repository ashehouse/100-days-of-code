# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 26, 2020 
##### Start: 10:14 am end 4:15pm

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** I was struggling understanding Flex vs Grid and how to center things. Turned out that getting text and images to center inside of a container required just a text-align command. I think I have a better understanding of flex. Tomorrow I will work on understanding grid better.

**Today's Progress**: Completely deleted by css on purpose to start over. 

**Thoughts:** Today marks the first official day of 'Stay Home, Stay Safe' orders from Bunbcombe County. You can go for hikes, go to the grocery store, and of course seek healthcare. Shouldn't change my life too much as that's prety much the way that I lived before. I'm trying to establish a routine for myself so that I can best utilize this time for learning to code. The idea is to structure my days like I'm in college. MWF two courses, TTH another two courses. I'm alos taking advantage of the nice weather and have set up my laptop outside on the porch. 

Update: not getting it. So struggling with this whole grid thing right now. I'm also don't think I'm understanding inheriting now. My boxes aren't centering and the grid isn't laying out how I want. The whole @media thing doesn't seem like its working. ugh. I need to take a break for today.
